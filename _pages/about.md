This summer, I am working with Professor Tjitske Starkenburg at Northwestern University's Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) as an REU student. I am conducting synthetic observations of globular cluster stellar streams using the (simulated) optics of the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, in order to better understand what this instrument might see when studying these exciting objects.
