## Introduction
Stellar streams are long, thin collections of stars which have been tidally stripped from a smaller object, such as a dwarf galaxy or globular cluster, by the galaxy the object orbits. As these streams orbit their host galaxies, their substructures, overall morphology, and stellar populations can provide insight on stellar halo structure, a galaxy’s dark matter distribution, and early star and galaxy formation in the Universe. As relatively dim objects located in the halos of more luminous galaxies, stellar streams are difficult to observe; as a result, testing the limits of upcoming instrumentation is crucial in both predicting what observations are possible and in interpreting data once an observation has been made. We conduct a synthetic observation of two simulated stellar streams modeled on a star-by-star basis in Panithanpaisal et al. (in prep) from the post-processed globular cluster population constructed by Grudić et al. (2023) and Rodriguez et al. (2023) using the FIRE-2 cosmological simulation. After studying the stellar populations of each stream, we simulate how the streams might appear to the Wide Field Instrument of the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope should they be located in the Andromeda Galaxy, thereby assessing whether this instrument will be able to observe extragalactic stellar streams.

## Results
We first study the internal stream structure and composition for both streams, including the apparent magnitudes of composite stars and stellar distributions of different star types. We find that all stellar types follow approximately the same distribution, possibly because tidal stripping of stars from progenitor clusters occurs primarily at pericenter, where the cluster's tidal radius is small. We then reposition the stellar streams around M31 to perform a mock observation of extragalactic stellar streams using the bands of the Roman space telescope. We find that the stellar streams studied here are comprised primarily of low-mass, low-luminosity stars. As such, most stream stars are not visible, and diffuse structures in the stream (such as 18573’s arm) may be missed by observation. However, the high central densities of stellar streams mean that their central regions and prominent structures (such as 18573’s shell) are readily accessible to observation. Both streams were visible in all Roman bands studied in a 1-hour mock observation of an extragalactic stream, particularly in the F213 (K) band, suggesting that the Roman space telescope is poised to greatly expand the study of extragalactic stellar streams.
